# NHANES Methodology and Design

Source: CDC/NCHS Documentation

## Survey Design

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies 
designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the 
United States.

### Key Features:
- Cross-sectional survey design
- Nationally representative sample
- Combines interviews and physical examinations
- Conducted by NCHS (National Center for Health Statistics)
- Part of CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)

## Sampling Strategy

NHANES uses a complex, multistage probability sampling design:

1. **Primary Sampling Units (PSUs)**: Counties or groups of counties
2. **Segments**: Census blocks or combinations
3. **Households**: Dwelling units within segments
4. **Individuals**: Persons within households

### Oversampling
Certain subgroups are oversampled to increase precision:
- Hispanic persons
- Non-Hispanic Black persons
- Non-Hispanic Asian persons
- Older adults (60+ years)
- Low-income white persons

## Data Collection

### Interview Component
- Demographic information
- Socioeconomic status
- Dietary intake (24-hour recall)
- Health-related questions

### Examination Component
- Body measurements (height, weight, waist circumference)
- Blood pressure
- Dental examination
- Laboratory tests (blood, urine)

## Survey Weights

NHANES provides sample weights to:
- Account for unequal probability of selection
- Adjust for nonresponse
- Post-stratify to population totals

**Important**: Always use sample weights for nationally representative estimates!
