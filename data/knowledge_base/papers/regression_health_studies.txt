# Regression Analysis in Health Studies

Source: Biostatistics and Epidemiology Literature

## Why Regression in Health Research?

Regression analysis allows researchers to:
- Identify risk factors for diseases
- Quantify relationships between variables
- Control for confounding variables
- Make predictions about health outcomes

## Linear Regression in NHANES

### Common Applications

1. **BMI Prediction**
   - Predictors: Age, sex, diet, physical activity
   - Model: BMI = β₀ + β₁(Age) + β₂(Sex) + ...

2. **Blood Pressure Studies**
   - Predictors: BMI, sodium intake, age, smoking
   - Outcome: Systolic/Diastolic BP

### Key Assumptions

1. **Linearity**: Relationship between X and Y is linear
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent
3. **Normality**: Residuals are normally distributed
4. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of residuals

### Interpreting Results

- R² = Proportion of variance explained
- β = Change in Y for 1-unit change in X
- p < 0.05 = Statistically significant
