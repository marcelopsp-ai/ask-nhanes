Topic: Normal distribution

In probability theory and statistics, a normal distribution or Gaussian distribution is a type of continuous probability distribution for a real-valued random variable. The general form of its probability density function is




f
(
x
)
=

π

σ

exp

σ

)



.


{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi \sigma ^{2}}}}\exp {\left(-{\frac {(x-\mu )^{2}}{2\sigma ^{2}}}\right)}\,.}


The parameter ⁠



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

⁠ is the mean or expectation of the distribution (and also its median and mode), while the parameter 




σ

2




{\textstyle \sigma ^{2}}

 is the variance. The standard deviation of the distribution is ⁠



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

⁠ (sigma). A random variable with a Gaussian distribution is said to be normally distributed and is called a normal deviate.

Normal distributions are important in statistics and are often used in the natural and social sciences to represent real-valued random variables whose distributions are not known. Their importance is partly due to the central limit theorem. It states that, under some conditions, the average of many samples (observations) of a random variable with finite mean and variance is itself a random variable—whose distribution converges to a normal distribution as the number of samples increases. Therefore, physical quantities that are expected to be the sum of many independent processes, such as measurement errors, often have distributions that are nearly normal.

Moreover, Gaussian distributions have some unique properties that are valuable in analytic studies. For instance, any linear combination of a fixed collection of independent normal deviates is a normal deviate. Many results and methods, such as propagation of uncertainty and least squares parameter fitting, can be derived analytically in explicit form when the relevant variables are normally distributed.

A normal distribution is sometimes informally called a bell curve. However, many other distributions are bell-shaped (such as the Cauchy, Student's t, and logistic distributions). (For other names, see Naming.)

The univariate probability distribution is generalized for vectors in the multivariate normal distribution and for matrices in the matrix normal distribution.

The simplest case of a normal distribution is known as the standard normal distribution or unit normal distribution. This is a special case when 



μ
=
0


{\textstyle \mu =0}

 and 




σ

2


=
1


{\textstyle \sigma ^{2}=1}

, and it is described by this probability density function (or density):




φ
(
z
)
=



e

−

z

2



/

2



2
π




.


{\displaystyle \varphi (z)={\frac {e^{-z^{2}/2}}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\,.}


The variable ⁠



z


{\displaystyle z}

⁠ has a mean of 0 and a variance and standard deviation of 1. The density 



φ
(
z
)


{\textstyle \varphi (z)}

 has its peak 





1

2
π





{\textstyle {\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}}

 at 



z
=
0


{\textstyle z=0}

 and inflection points at 



z
=
+
1


{\textstyle z=+1}

 and ⁠



z
=
−
1


{\displaystyle z=-1}

⁠.

Although the density above is most commonly known as the standard normal, a few authors have used that term to describe other versions of the normal distribution. Carl Friedrich Gauss, for example, once defined the standard normal as




φ
(
z
)
=



e

−

z

2





π



,


{\displaystyle \varphi (z)={\frac {e^{-z^{2}}}{\sqrt {\pi }}},}


which has a variance of ⁠





1
2




{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}

⁠, and Stephen Stigler once defined the standard normal as




φ
(
z
)
=

e

−
π

z

2




,


{\displaystyle \varphi (z)=e^{-\pi z^{2}},}


which has a simple functional form and a variance of 




σ

2


=


1

2
π



.


{\textstyle \sigma ^{2}={\frac {1}{2\pi }}.}

Every normal distribution is a version of the standard normal distribution whose domain has been stretched by a factor ⁠



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

⁠ (the standard deviation) and then translated by ⁠



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

⁠ (the mean value):




f
(
x
∣
μ
,

σ

2


)
=


1
σ


φ

(



x
−
μ

σ


)


.


{\displaystyle f(x\mid \mu ,\sigma ^{2})={\frac {1}{\sigma }}\varphi \left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)\,.}

The probability density must be scaled by 



1

/

σ


{\textstyle 1/\sigma }

 so that the integral is still 1.

If ⁠



Z


{\displaystyle Z}

⁠ is a standard normal deviate, then 



X
=
σ
Z
+
μ


{\textstyle X=\sigma Z+\mu }

 will have a normal distribution with expected value ⁠



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

⁠ and standard deviation ⁠



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

⁠. This is equivalent to saying that the standard normal distribution ⁠



Z


{\displaystyle Z}

⁠ can be scaled/stretched by a factor of ⁠



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

⁠ and shifted by ⁠



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

⁠ to yield a different normal distribution, called ⁠



X


{\displaystyle X}

⁠. Conversely, if ⁠



X


{\displaystyle X}

⁠ is a normal deviate with parameters ⁠



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

⁠ and 




σ

2




{\textstyle \sigma ^{2}}

, then this ⁠



X


{\displaystyle X}

⁠ distribution can be re-scaled and shifted via the formula 



Z
=
(
X
−
μ
)

/

σ


{\textstyle Z=(X-\mu )/\sigma }

 to convert it to the standard normal distribution. This variate is also called the standardized form of ⁠



X


{\displaystyle X}

⁠.

The probability density of the standard Gaussian distribution (standard normal distribution, with zero mean and unit variance) is often denoted with the Greek letter ⁠



ϕ


{\displaystyle \phi }

⁠ (phi). The alternative form of the Greek letter phi, ⁠



φ


{\displaystyle \varphi }

⁠, is also used quite often.

The normal distribution is often referred to as 



N
(
μ
,

σ

2


)


{\textstyle N(\mu ,\sigma ^{2})}

 or ⁠





N


(
μ
,

σ

2


)


{\displaystyle {\mathcal {N}}(\mu ,\sigma ^{2})}

⁠. Thus when a random variable ⁠



X


{\displaystyle X}

⁠ is normally distributed with mean ⁠



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

⁠ and standard deviation ⁠



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

⁠, one may write

X
∼


N


(
μ
,

σ

2


)
.


{\displaystyle X\sim {\mathcal {N}}(\mu ,\sigma ^{2}).}

Some authors advocate using the precision ⁠



τ


{\displaystyle \tau }

⁠ as the parameter defining the width of the distribution, instead of the standard deviation ⁠



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

⁠ or the variance ⁠




σ

2




{\displaystyle \sigma ^{2}}

⁠. The precision is normally defined as the reciprocal of the variance, ⁠



1

/


σ

2




{\displaystyle 1/\sigma ^{2}}

⁠. The formula for the distribution then becomes




f
(
x
)
=



τ

2
π





e

−
τ
(
x
−
μ

)

2



/

2


.


{\displaystyle f(x)={\sqrt {\frac {\tau }{2\pi }}}e^{-\tau (x-\mu )^{2}/2}.}

This choice is claimed to have advantages in numerical computations when ⁠



σ


{\displaystyle \sigma }

⁠ is very close to zero, and simplifies formulas in some contexts, such as in the Bayesian inference of variables with multivariate normal distribution.

Alternatively, the reciprocal of the standard deviation 




τ
′

=
1

/

σ


{\textstyle \tau '=1/\sigma }

 might be defined as the precision, in which case the expression of the normal distribution becomes




f
(
x
)
=



τ

2
π




e

−
(

τ

)

(
x
−
μ

)

2



/

2


.


{\displaystyle f(x)={\frac {\tau '}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}e^{-(\tau ')^{2}(x-\mu )^{2}/2}.}

According to Stigler, this formulation is advantageous because of a much simpler and easier-to-remember formula, and simple approximate formulas for the quantiles of the distribution.

Normal distributions form an exponential family with natural parameters 





θ

μ

σ

{\textstyle \textstyle \theta _{1}={\frac {\mu }{\sigma ^{2}}}}

 and 





θ

2


=



−
1

σ

2








{\textstyle \textstyle \theta _{2}={\frac {-1}{2\sigma ^{2}}}}

, and natural statistics x and x. The dual expectation parameters for normal distribution are η1 = μ and η2 = μ + σ.

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal distribution, usually denoted with the capital Greek letter ⁠



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }

⁠, is the integral

{\displaystyle \Phi (x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\int _{-\infty }^{x}e^{-t^{2}/2}\,dt\,.}

The related error function 



erf
⁡
(
x
)


{\textstyle \operatorname {erf} (x)}

 gives the probability of a random variable, with normal distribution of mean 0 and variance 1/2, falling in the range ⁠



[

x

{\displaystyle [-x,x]}

⁠. That is:

{\displaystyle \operatorname {erf} (x)={\frac {1}{\sqrt {\pi }}}\int _{-x}^{x}e^{-t^{2}}\,dt={\frac {2}{\sqrt {\pi }}}\int _{0}^{x}e^{-t^{2}}\,dt\,.}

These integrals cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, and are often said to be special functions. However, many numerical approximations are known; see below for more.

The two functions are closely related, namely

{\displaystyle \Phi (x)={\frac {1}{2}}\left[1+\operatorname {erf} \left({\frac {x}{\sqrt {2}}}\right)\right].}

For a generic normal distribution with density ⁠



f


{\displaystyle f}

⁠, mean ⁠



μ


{\displaystyle \mu }

⁠ and variance 




σ

2




{\textstyle \sigma ^{2}}

, the cumulative distribution function is

{\displaystyle F(x)=\Phi {\left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma }}\right)}={\frac {1}{2}}\left[1+\operatorname {erf} \left({\frac {x-\mu }{\sigma {\sqrt {2}}}}\right)\right].}

The probability that x lies in the semi-closed interval (a,b], where (a < b], is therefore

The complement of the standard normal cumulative distribution function, 



Q
(
x
)
=
1
−
Φ
(
x
)


{\textstyle Q(x)=1-\Phi (x)}

, is often called the Q-function, especially in engineering texts. It gives the probability that the value of a standard normal random variable ⁠



X


{\displaystyle X}

⁠ will exceed ⁠



x


{\displaystyle x}

⁠: ⁠



P
(
X
>
x
)


{\displaystyle P(X>x)}

⁠. Other definitions of the ⁠



Q


{\displaystyle Q}

⁠-function, all of which are simple transformations of ⁠



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }

⁠, are also used occasionally.

The graph of the standard normal cumulative distribution function ⁠



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }

⁠ has 2-fold rotational symmetry around the point (0,1/2); that is, ⁠



Φ
(
−
x
)
=
1
−
Φ
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \Phi (-x)=1-\Phi (x)}

⁠. Its antiderivative (indefinite integral) can be expressed as follows:




∫
Φ
(
x
)

d
x
=
x
Φ
(
x
)
+
φ
(
x
)
+
C
.


{\displaystyle \int \Phi (x)\,dx=x\Phi (x)+\varphi (x)+C.}

The cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution can be expanded by integration by parts into a series:

x
)

{\displaystyle \Phi (x)={\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\cdot e^{-x^{2}/2}\left[x+{\frac {x^{3}}{3}}+{\frac {x^{5}}{3\cdot 5}}+\cdots +{\frac {x^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)!!}}+\cdots \right]\,.}


where 



!
!


{\textstyle !!}

 denotes the double factorial.

An asymptotic expansion of the cumulative distribution function for large x can also be derived using integration by parts. For more, see Error function § Asymptotic expansion.

A quick approximation to the standard normal distribution's cumulative distribution function can be found by using a Taylor series approximation:




Φ

{\displaystyle \Phi (x)\approx {\frac {1}{2}}+{\frac {1}{\sqrt {2\pi }}}\sum _{k=0}^{n}{\frac {(-1)^{k}x^{(2k+1)}}{2^{k}k!(2k+1)}}\,.}

The recursive nature of the

An application for the above Taylor series expansion is to use Newton's method to reverse the computation.  That is, if we have a value for the cumulative distribution function, 



Φ
(
x
)


{\textstyle \Phi (x)}

, but do not know the x needed to obtain the 



Φ
(
x
)


{\textstyle \Phi (x)}

, we can use Newton's method to find x, and use the Taylor series expansion above to minimize the number of computations.  Newton's method is ideal to solve this problem because the first derivative of 



Φ
(
x
)


{\textstyle \Phi (x)}

, which is an integral of the normal standard distribution, is the normal standard distribution, and is readily available to use in the Newton's method solution.

To solve, select a known approximate solution, 




x

{\textstyle x_{0}}

, to the desired ⁠



Φ
(
x
)


{\displaystyle \Phi (x)}

⁠.  




x

{\textstyle x_{0}}

 may be a value from a distribution table, or an intelligent estimate followed by a computation of 



Φ

 using any desired means to compute. Use this value of 




x

{\textstyle x_{0}}

 and the Taylor series expansion above to minimize computations.

Repeat the following process until the difference between the computed

{\textstyle \Phi (x_{n})}

 and the desired ⁠



Φ


{\displaystyle \Phi }

⁠, which we will call
